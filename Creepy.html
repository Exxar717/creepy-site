            <p style="font-family: Helvetica, sans-serif;"> We first heard about this wierd creature from a Latino friend. He told us a story.
                 A story about a ghoul like creature.<br><br><i>We were alone at our farm that night. By alone I mean me and my brother Fernando.
                    That was a very common evening, I was eating my dinner with some stashed beer. And Fernando, my younger brother, was playing videogames. At that time I heard some sound.
                 I didn`t even realise what that sound was, it was very strange. But then it got louder. I didn`t want to scare my brother, but I wanted to know if I`m not crazy, so I asked him to listen.
                 "I don`t hear anything" - he answered with one of his earphones down. And then it got really loud. He heard it too. It was scary. Like really scary. It sounded like mixed version of a 
                 chicken scream and a dog howl. It screamed again, and again. And then we heard a human scream. I think a man screamed. I was very scared but i took my father`s binoculars and crawled to the window.
                 The first thing I saw was a pile of dead chickens, but then I noticed something near the bushes. The image is still in my head. A ghoul like creature, covered in blood, raping a man.
                 A man screemed, I told Fernando to call the police, but the phone was somewhere upstairs, and we both were too scared to move. We both hid in the basement. At least for a couple of hours.
                 Parents came back at 11 PM. They found us scared to death in the basement. We have tried to explain to them what happened. But they didn`t believe a word. My father said that probably it were
                 coyotes who killed chickens. We didn`t find a man, but we found some strange human like footprints. To this day, sometimes, I have nightmares.</i><br><br>That was his story.
                 I dont know about you, but I belived the guy. He was genuinely scared when he was telling this story.</p>

                <p style="font-family: Georgia, serif;">One of the old books that sits in my shelf tells a very interesting story, about a person who was known as "mr.Haning"<br><br>
                <i>Some long time ago, in a small town in the state of West Virginia, lived a man named mr.Haning. Mr.Haning was rich. But not because he inhereted some money, but because he worked hard.
                    He owned a big farm, and a big house right in the middle of it. He had a wife, and a beautiful child named Benjamin. His love for them was deep, and they loved him back.
                    He was fair and honest to his workers, not only to them but to every person, that is why he was respected and loved. It looked like almost every person in this little town 
                    new mr.Haning, and everyone thought only good about him. Almost everyone. But one woman, whose name was Marsa, didn`t like him. Why, may you ask? There were rumors.
                     One of these rumors said that, when mr.Haning and Marsa were both young, he promised his heart to her. But later, he met his future wife, and abandoned Marsa. Marsa loved him 
                     so much, that she was unable to forgive him. This Marsa wasn`t an ordinary woman. People usually came to her with unsolvable problems. Those who used her services, always told 
                     the same thing: "She knows magic", "She uses woodoo", "She is a witch". But nevertheless people kept coming, and she kept using dark arts to help them.<br><br>
                    That happened one rainy March night. mr.Haning invited some friends to his house. They ate some good fried deer, and drank some heavy alochol. His wife went to the kitchen, 
                    to ensure that the desert was coming all right. And a little Benjamin was playing with a toy horse in the corner. One of his friends "Collins" decided to talk about one delicate subject.
                     A second later, Collins and Haning started to argue. Another second later Haning punched Collins in the face. Collins eyes went mad, he picked up a knife from the table and put that knife 
                     in the Huning`s eye. A body fell, a child screamed, a widow ran into the room. When the newfound widow ran into the room she saw two scared to death men, a crying child in the corner, 
                     and a body, whose face was covered with blood.<br><br>
                     The news about mr.Haning`s death flew around in the next few hours. Marsa came to the Haning`s Mansion the day after. She came to the crying widow, and whispered to her ear:"I can bring him back". 
                     The widow was shocked, but she said "Yes" immediately. Marsa took some blood from every member of the Huning`s family. She sacrificed one of their favourite horses. 
                     She said:"We have to give a lot to gain a lot". She spoke some words that no one understood. And he came back. Mr.Haning who was dead for 24 hours, came back. His wife could not believe 
                     her eyes, Benjamin shouted:"Daddy!". But mr.Haning just stood still. He stood like that until Marsa moved her fingers. She moved her fingers once, and Haning turned to her. She moved her fingers 
                     twice and he came closer to her. She said:"I love you". And he said "i love you" back. Then Marsa turned around and left the Mansion. Haning followed her.<br><br>
                     Over the next ten years the widow had gone mad. One day she fell into the well and broke her neck. Benjamin was unable to continue to live in this town, that is why, when he inhereted 
                     the family money, farm and mansion, he sold everything and moved to another state. And Marsa. People of this small town said that they saw someone like her in the woods. And they also said 
                     that they saw a wierd man-like creature who followed her every step.</i></p>

            <h3><img src="uLab.jpg" alt="uLab" style="float: left;">UFO lab</h3>
            <p style="font-family: 'Courier New', monospace;">This story was published in a newspaper of a small town, that is somewhere in Minnesota. Only a few people actually used to buy this newspaper, and after they had published this story 
                this newspaper just dissapeared, as well as the people who wrote the article.<br><br>
                <i>A man named John contacted us 2 days ago. He sounded a little bit crazy, but nothing I haven`t heard before. He said something about the UFO kidnapping. I thought "Well just another psycho". 
                    He really insisted on meeting me in person, and on keeping his identity in secret. I agreed to meet him in person, and the story he told sounded 100% different from everything I have ever 
                    heard about the UFO kidnapping. <br><br>
                    "I was driving home from my late evening shift. I was in my car, sober, driving on my usual road, listeting to my usual casette. Nothing felt wrong. I still had do drive something 
                    around 1 mile to my house, I passed the grocery, turned left and then my car just stopped and a beam of very bright light appeared out of nowhere. But I wasn`t beamed up or anything.
                    My car just stood still. Engine stopped working. Then two men, at least I think they were men, came to my car. They were definitely humans, but they looked kinda different. It looked like 
                    every thing on ther face was slightly bigger then it should have been. And their skin. No they weren`t lizzards or anything. Their skin was kinda normal. The color, it was white with a hint of purple.
                    I was unable to move, like my body didn`t move. These two were talking to each other, their speech souded like ours, but words, their words sounded so odd. I would not be able to repeat them. 
                    Then they just opened my door, and took me. One of them took me with his hands, and it felt like that was very easy for him. I weight 220 pounds. I am not small. Then they just opened my mouth 
                    and put something in it. And I blacked out.<br><br>
                    I woke up on a hospital bed. I turned my head to the left and tried to look out of the window. But it was all black. And the room looked like a normal hospital room. Except for 
                    some shiny blinking device in the corner. I was able to stand up, though it was very hard to move my legs or arms. I walked to the door, and heard that someone was running outside the door.
                    He yelled something, it sounded like "HELP" but like he was unable to move his lips properly. I was too scared to open the door. So I just stood there. I heard that someone ran after 
                    him and heard that a body dropped on the floor. Than I heard that someone just walked away, calmly. After a few moments I opened the door, and decided that I should sneak away. It still 
                    was very hard to move, but I kept walking. I walked untill I reached the doors of a surgery. I peeked through the window. I saw three of these human-like creatures standing around 
                    the table. It looked like they were discussing something. Then one of them went to the other table, and when he left I was able to see a normal human body laying on the table. The chest 
                    of this person was wide open. They were taking his innards out, and that one creature was studying them with a microscope. While I stood there, another of these creatures came behind me, 
                    and put a mask on my head. And I blacked out again.<br><br>
                    I woke up in my car, in front of my house. I was extremely sore and tired. I could hardly move. Somehow I walked to my house, opened the front door, and then just fell asleep on the carpet. 
                    My wife said that she had to ask our neighbor for help, to move me to my bed. I slept for 24 hours straight. When I woke up, I told my wife that I was just extremely tired, that the last few days were 
                    very hard and etc. But that was a lie. I wasn`t tired or overworked or anything. I was 100% okay. I just new that she would not believe me if I tell her what I told you."<br><br>
                    A few days later I was contacted by another person who said that they saw this John meeting me, and that they want to have a chat with me, so expect another great story next week!</i></p>
